Notes on troubleshooting BTRFS
by Martin Monperrus -- Tagged as: linux
I've recently come across a hard file-system error:

  BTRFS critical (device sda2): corrupt leaf, slot offset bad: block=43231330304,root=1, slot=47
It was on my BTRFS file system on top of an SSD (Solid-state drive).

Despite the error message, it turned out that the problem was not at the file-system level but more at the hard-drive level. I had 100+ sectors that were not readable anymore (according to badblocks)

The solution was to reset the SSD with an ATA instruction "Secure Erase", and to reinstall a brand new file-system.

  # see https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase
  hdparm --user-master u --security-erase Eins /dev/
Troubleshooting
How to identify the corrupted files?

  $ btrfs scrub status /mount-point
then check the path in dmesg:

  BTRFS: i/o error at logical 167135232000 on dev /dev/sda2, sector 213189792, root 5,
    inode 2963892, offset 7700480, length 4096, links 1 (path: /home/foo...)
Solution by Duncan [3], thanks

How to identify bad sectors?

run badblocks

  $ badblocks -b 512 -n /dev/sda
(with "-b 512", the number you obtain corresponds to the sector id to be given to hdparm, see below)

How to know whether there are reallocated sectors?

  smartctl -A /dev/sda
Row "Reallocated_Sector_Ct" (ID #5).

Note that this row contains several values and Each Attribute also has a Threshold value (whose range is 0 to 255) which is printed under the heading "THRESH". If the Normalized value (column Value) is less than or equal to the Threshold value, then the Attribute is said to have failed. If the Attribute is a pre-failure Attribute, then disk failure is imminent. (see man page [4])

smartctl -x /dev/sda gives a wealth of additional information.

How to test a low-level read error?

Once you've identified a bad sector, you can test it with hdparm:

  hdparm --read-sector 213189792 /dev/sda
If there is an error, you'll get something like reading sector 213189792: FAILED: Input/output error

How to force re-allocation?

For a specific sector, use hdparm, see [5], [6]

For the whole drive, use badblocks [7]

  badblocks -w /dev/sda
The EXT4 file system has an option to check for bad blocks at creation time (mkfs.ext4 -cc). It may be a good idea, this forces sector reallocation before putting any important data on the disk [8].

How to run the drive firmware self-tests?

  smartct -t long /dev/sda
To get the results: smartctl -x /dev/sda

Open questions
How to identify the corrupted files from a block identifier (block=43231330304)?

What's the difference between ATA Security Erase and ATA Enhanced Security Erase?

What does smartctl's "Runtime_Bad_Block" field mean?

Does a bad sector indicate a failing SSD? Not clear, see [9] and [10]

What is indeed the root cause of the problem? Is it in BTRFS? in the SSD firmware? Because of my use of ecryptfs on top of btrfs on top of a SSD?
