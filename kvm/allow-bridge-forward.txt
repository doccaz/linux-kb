In recent kernels, the default FORWARD chain action is DROP.

The effects seen on KVM:
- guest to guest communication is no longer possible even with ip_forward set to 1 on sysctl (guest to host works though)
- guest to internet communication is blocked.


To fix:

Set these parameters in sysctl:


# needed to allow guest to guest communication in KVM
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 0

and add a FORWARD rule for your bridge interface:

# firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --passthrough ipv4 -I FORWARD -i virbr-suse -j ACCEPT
# firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --passthrough ipv4 -I FORWARD -o virbr-suse -j ACCEPT
# firewall-cmd --reload


where 'virbr-suse' is the name of your bridge interface.
