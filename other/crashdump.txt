if you set kernel.softlockup_panic=1 and kdump is setup, a soft lockup will cause a crash dump 

on concord.suse.cloud: 
sync-case

crashPrep.py -e <kernel version>

crash vmlinux-<version>.gz vmlinux-<version>.debug vmcore


commands:
dmesg
bt
cpu
ps | grep RU   --- running processes
runqueues --- running queues
bt <pid> -- stack trace for a pid
foreach bt --- runs a backtrace for all pids
ps -g --- group tasks by cpu


memory addresses starting with fffffff = userspace processes
kworker tasks stopped at __schedule are idle waiting for processes
