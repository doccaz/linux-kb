To convert a list of dicts to a single dict and remove duplicates, a possible solution using names as the new keys:

new_dict = {}
for item in data:
   name = item['name']
   new_dict[name] = item
With python 3.x you can also use dict comprehensions for the same approach in a more nice way:

new_dict = {item['name']:item for item in data}
As suggested in a comment by Paul McGuire, if you don't want the name in the inner dict, you can do:

new_dict = {}
for item in data:
   name = item.pop('name')
   new_dict[name] = item
