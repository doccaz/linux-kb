Reference: https://www.antixforum.com/forums/topic/hotkey-to-remember-window-size-and-position-for-icewm/
====================

With help from the IceWM devs to come up with the string, this will make it easy to add or update an override window geometry for any particular program.

This is usable for those able to edit the IceWM keys file, because you need to add a hotkey to make it work. I assigned it to Win+R for Remember Window.

key "Super+r" /bin/sh -c "$HOME/add_geo_entry"

It runs a little script called $HOME/add_geo_entry. The way its setup at the moment it needs to be in your home directory to work, and has to be executable. I will try to paste the script here if the website will allow it, but it needs to be saved as add_geo_entry and made executable to work. Let me know if you have any problems, comments or possible improvements. This is a first try, and no, there is no way I would have figured out the first bunch of lines myself. LOL, I assembled the easy stuff at the endâ€¦

Life is a learning experience everyday, but if we put in a little effort, maybe tomorrow will be a little better.
